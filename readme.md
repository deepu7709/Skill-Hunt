**CONCLUSION**

I did this project as a task by the Elitmus. Working alone for about 4 to 5 days and bringing out an end product is not just an easy task. It involved a lot of learning, brain storming, coding and resolving errors. I believe that these stressful days have brought the best out of me.

Please feel free to ask doubts, edit errors and ping me at my e-mail.

Happy learning!
